This projects is focused on hands-on log analysis and detection scripts built while learning and practicing Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- How raw logs can be analyzed without a SIEM ?

- How common attack patterns appear in real log data ?

- How simple automation (shell scripting) can be used to detect suspicious behavior ?

- How an analyst reasons about indicators of compromise (IOCs), false positives, and thresholds ?

All examples focus on practical analysis, not just theoretical concepts.

This project covers:

- Web server log analysis (Apache / Nginx – combined log format)

- Authentication and login behavior analysis

- Use of command-line tools for investigation
- Basic automation using shell scripts
